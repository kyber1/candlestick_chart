# 🕯️ Power BI Custom Candlestick Chart

This is my own **candlestick chart** built for **Power BI**. It displays **candlesticks with wicks** along with **volume bars** to visualize price movements effectively. 

## 📌 About

This visual is built using **Power BI’s pbiviz framework**, allowing seamless integration with Power BI reports. It leverages **D3.js** for drawing the candlesticks and wicks.

## 🚀 Development

To work with this visual, clone the repository and ensure you have `pbiviz` installed. Then, run:

```sh
pbiviz start
